# CARCAS Models
This repository is no longer active. The current version is https://github.com/DigitalCarleton/carcas.

A Datalad dataset to store the CARCAS `*.glb` models and the posters. 

Ideally, this dataset is connected to the server's URL as a web remote 
(feature of git-annex) so that anyone can download the models as needed
without them being stored on GitHub.
